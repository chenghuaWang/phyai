"""Constraints that used to be hand-rolled per model, now declared on the rows.

Six functions across `models/pi0`, `models/pi05` and `models/minicpm_gr00t`
rewrote a backend *name* at construction time — "flashinfer has no AdaRMS kernel,
use Triton", "the vision tower runs fp32, flashinfer's norm needs bf16",
"head_dim is 72, flashinfer's prefill wants 64/128/256". They existed because the
backend arrived as one global name for the whole model, so a model that could not
use it locally had to rename it.

The names are gone and so are the rewrites. These tests assert the catalog
reaches the same conclusion on its own — they are the standing evidence for the
three models that have no checkpoint here (`minicpm_gr00t`, `qwen3_5`,
`gr00t_n17`), where a bit-exact before/after is not available.
