class PagedAttention(nn.Module):
    """Static-allocation cache-pool-aware varlen attention over paged KV.

    "Static" means the KV slots come from a one-shot
    :class:`~phyai.cache.static_cache.StaticCache` allocator (contiguous
    range, reset between requests, no eviction). The attention module
    itself is allocator-agnostic — it just routes ``q``/``k``/``v`` to
    the runner-supplied backend through ``ctx``.

    One class serves every paged consumer; what used to be two identical
    subsystems ("ar" and "diffusion") is expressed per layer:

    * the LM prefix of a VLA constructs
      ``PagedAttention(..., causal=False, kernel_role="prefix")``
      (PaliGemma-style bidirectional prefix) or ``causal=True`` for a
      genuine AR decoder;
    * the action expert's joint attention over prefix + suffix slots
      constructs ``PagedAttention(..., causal=False, kernel_role="expert")``
      — the block structure comes from which KV slots the metadata makes
      visible, not from a mask.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_heads:
        Query head count.
    head_dim:
        Per-head dimension.
    layer_id:
        Index into the :class:`KVCachePool`'s per-layer K/V buffers.
        Required.
    causal:
        Causal mask flag. Required — the merged stack serves both
        causal decoders and bidirectional prefix/expert layers, so the
        caller states which one this layer is.
    num_kv_heads:
        K/V head count (defaults to ``num_heads`` for full MHA).
    scale:
        Softmax scale, defaults to ``1 / sqrt(head_dim)``.
    backend:
        Canonical name of the backend the runner will resolve for
        this stack (``"flashinfer"`` for GPU paged-KV — the only
        backend; the paged stack is flashinfer-only).
        Validated against the kernel catalog at construction; the
        layer itself does not instantiate the backend.
    kernel_role:
        Policy-visible role for this call site (``"prefix"``,
        ``"expert"``, or a caller-chosen name).
