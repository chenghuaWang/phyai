"""Process-wide torch state: thread pools, RNG seeding, autograd mode.

Three entry points the engine calls once at startup, split out of
:class:`~phyai.engine.Engine` for the same reason as
:func:`~phyai.utils.cuda.init_cuda` — each is independently callable, so a
test or a bespoke harness can opt into one without the full engine
bootstrap.

The distinction from :mod:`phyai.utils.env_setup` matters: that module
writes ``os.environ``, which mostly affects *child* processes; this one
mutates torch globals that take effect immediately in *this* process.
Where the two overlap (thread counts) both are needed, and neither is
sufficient alone — see :func:`init_threads`.

Default dtype is deliberately not here. It is pinned for inference by
:func:`phyai.utils.cuda.init_cuda`.
``torch.set_default_device`` is deliberately never set: phyai layers pass
``device=`` explicitly, and host-side tensors (``cu_seqlens``, sampling
metadata) must stay on CPU.

            ``1`` on an accelerator, and *no change at all* on CPU.

    Returns:
        The effective ``torch.get_num_threads()`` after the call.

    On an accelerator the CPU only builds metadata and launches kernels,
    so torch's default pool (one thread per core) buys nothing and costs
    two things. First, weight loading gets slower, not faster — many
    threads contend on the same shard reads and allocator locks (sglang
    sets ``num_threads=1`` right before ``load_model`` for exactly this
    reason). Second, and worse for phyai's latency-critical robot
    workloads: TP=8 or several DP replicas on one box means eight
    processes each opening a core-count-sized pool, oversubscribing the
    machine by an order of magnitude and showing up as launch-side jitter
    in p99.

    A CPU target is the opposite case — the pool *is* the compute — so
    ``None`` leaves it untouched rather than crippling CPU inference and
    the CPU-default test suite.

    ``torch.set_num_interop_threads`` is attempted too, but only ever
    best-effort: torch refuses it once any parallel work has started, and
    a late call must not fail a launch.
