"""Fact derivation shared by the four attention stacks.

The stacks differ in their tensor contracts — the cacheless one is the only one
supporting a rectangular ``S_q != S_kv``, the paged pair scatter K/V
themselves, and GDN takes eight tensors — but they derive their *selection
facts* the same way. Six call sites used to re-implement this, two of them with
a different expression for the 4-D token count.
